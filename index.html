        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Kris Dong is a tech-savvy individual with a persistent passion for hardware-software co-design in accelerating autonomous robotics and machine learning applications. She is currently working as a Ph.D. graduate student researcher at UC Berkeley, and affiliated with Berkeley Computer Architecture Research - SLICE lab and Berkeley Wireless Research Center, advised by Prof. Sophia Yakun Shao, and Prof. Christopher W. Fletcher.

            Kris’ research domain lies in building domain-specific accelerators for autonomous robotics. Her recent publication redefines the evaluation of specialized hardware for robotic systems. She built RoSÉ, a unified simulation platform that combines hardware and software, enabling pre-silicon, full-stack, closed-loop evaluation of robotic systems. For further analysis of the effect of architectures and software on robot behavior, she developed multi-stage robotics pipelines to evaluate dynamic end-to-end workloads to support autonomous navigation, optical-flow-based pose estimation, computer vision, occupancy grid mapping, and trajectory planning and control.
            
            Prior to joining Berkeley, she had worked as a Software Engineer at Tesla and a Product Manager at Amazon. She has 6+ years of programming experience through internships and projects involving hardware architecture design, large-scale system development, and full-stack software development. She holds a dual master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department of UC Berkeley; with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science, and a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance from UMass Amherst.</p>
